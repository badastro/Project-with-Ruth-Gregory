Description: Phase space plots of the spatial locations of 20,000 particles in the x axis vs z axis (top) and the y axis vs z axis (bottom). This is the plot of the initial conditions (time=0).

<img src="FODO3d_vzvsz.png" data-canonical-src="FODO3d_vzvsz.png" width="240" height="240" />

Description: Phase space plot of 20,000 particles with their velocity in the z direction plotted against their position in the z direction. This is the plot of the initial conditions (time=0).

Description: Electrostatic potential of the 20,000 simulated particles in the z-x plane (top) and in the z-y plane (bottom). The electrostatic potential has units of volts.
