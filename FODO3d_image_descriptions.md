Description: I spent about 6 hours on Monday trying to figure out what this was, it's something that is calculated by this envelope solver code included in the warp package, and some of it is in Fortran. The envelope solver thing does a lot of calculations and this is some sort of representation of the results from that.

Description: Phase space plots of the spatial locations of 20,000 particles in the x axis vs z axis (top) and the y axis vs z axis (bottom). This is the plot of the initial conditions (time=0).
