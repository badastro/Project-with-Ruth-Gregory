In circular particle accelerators, beams of particles are steered by magnetic fields. This is accomplished with the use of quadrupole magnets. Depending on itâ€™s magnetic field gradient, a quadrupole magnet will focus a particle beam in one plane, and defocus the beam in another perpendicular plane. In order to create a net focusing effect, accelerators are set up with a series of quadrupole magnets that alternate in the sign of their magnetic field gradient. The equations of motion for particles going through these magnets can be calculated and expressed with transfer matrices. The motion of these particles is sinusoidal.

In this simulation we used Python code to simulate a beam of particles going through one unit cell of a FODO lattice. This simulation took physical aspects of the beam and magnets as input parameters to show how the particles move. The simulation produced graphical displays of the position and momentum of the beam, as well as the electromagnetic fields experienced by the beam. This has a real world application of demonstrating how particle beams move in real accelerators.
