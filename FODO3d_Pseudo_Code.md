Create a species of ions that will be simulated

Set up some parameters:

  - Specify initial conditions for the particle beam

  - Call a built in function that will calculate some of the beam parameters based on the specified initial conditions

  - Set the longitudinal thermal velocity spread based on the emittance

  - Set the parameters for the FODO lattice

  - Set the quadrupole magnetic field gradient to determine the phase advance of the lattice

  - Set up a focusing and defocusing quadrupole for one lattice period

  - Define the start of the periodicity of the lattice and the lenght of the lattice period

Set up and run the envelope solver

  - Specify the tune length
  
  - Specify upper and lower limits for the particles in the z direction
  
  - Run the envelope solver
  
Set up some parameters that describe the 3D simulation

  - Tell the program how big the plots should be, how they should look, etc.
  
  - Specify the distribution of the beam position and velocity. Ours is gaussian.
  
Make all the plots/movies based on the results generated by the code
