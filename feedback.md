## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: It sounds like your project will be modeling the motion of particles using a Python module. I think the idea behind your project is reasonable, but I'm concerned about the scale of what you might do. So, in the next writeup as you begin to plan the project, I want to see more detail about what you will actually do. That module is a pretty complete, research-level tool and I'd be concerned about you biting off too much on this. I think you will also want to not just use the module, but also explain how the algorithm is working and what is being modeled. So in the next writeup, please begin to document that and explain what you will do in more detail. This is a project that does align with what I'm expecting of you; I just want to make sure that you are proposing something that is tractable in the amount of time you have while still hitting all the important points of the project.

* Score: 20/20
