## Homework assignment 5

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, thanks for doing exactly what I asked of you. I think you have everything you need here for a poster (in fact, you might have too many figures!). You will need to think about how to conceptually lay out your poster so that folks understand the system, then what the model is doing, and then the results (i.e., the figures). I suspect this will take some thinking on your part this week as you have a lot to work with. I don't think you need code in the poster, but you can talk through pseudocode or even just explain what he code does in a step-by-step manner. In any event, I'd suggest that you try to make a mock poster up and choose the feedback that you need to make it better. Great job this week!

## Homework assignment 4

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I'm happy to see you've gotten the code working. Because you are modifying existing code, I will have a much hgiher demand on you being able to explain what the code is doing and how you know that. Additionally, you will need to be able to explain all the plots that it appears to produce. It's fine to use an exisiting package like you are, but you will need to make sure that you understand how everything works and be able to explain it. I would say you should spend the week making sure that you can do that. Great job getting things working.

## Homework assignment 3

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I'm glad to see that you feel the contributions on this work are equal and complementary. I am getting the sense that things are progressing, but I didn't see any graphic or background work in your repository besides that information that you have gotten the software installed. It will be quite prudent to make sure that you have some sample calculations and results this week, which is why the homework is minimized this week. Please take care to make sure that you do this work quickly adn thoroughly as it will be helpful to me to be able to see your progress and offer guidance and helpful to you to get the feedback.

## Homework assignment 2

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I think I have a really good idea of how you will split up the work, which is important that you both agreed on how that will look. I think I'm still a bit unclear of the objective of the project (i.e., what you will model, what scale of problem you are intending to solve, etc.). The general statements about using the module to model particles doesn't let me know what you are limiting yourself to do or including in the model. Let me suggest that you start with some of the simplest models that you can explain easily (i.e., does the module let you model the motion of chsrges in constant electric and magnetic fields?) and can you then make these models more complex? I think that might hepl me understand what level you are aiming for in the end.

## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: It sounds like your project will be modeling the motion of particles using a Python module. I think the idea behind your project is reasonable, but I'm concerned about the scale of what you might do. So, in the next writeup as you begin to plan the project, I want to see more detail about what you will actually do. That module is a pretty complete, research-level tool and I'd be concerned about you biting off too much on this. I think you will also want to not just use the module, but also explain how the algorithm is working and what is being modeled. So in the next writeup, please begin to document that and explain what you will do in more detail. This is a project that does align with what I'm expecting of you; I just want to make sure that you are proposing something that is tractable in the amount of time you have while still hitting all the important points of the project.
