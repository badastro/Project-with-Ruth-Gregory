## Homework assignment 2

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I think I have a really good idea of how you will split up the work, which is important that you both agreed on how that will look. I think I'm still a bit unclear of the objective of the project (i.e., what you will model, what scale of problem you are intending to solve, etc.). The general statements about using the module to model particles doesn't let me know what you are limiting yourself to do or including in the model. Let me suggest that you start with some of the simplest models that you can explain easily (i.e., does the module let you model the motion of chsrges in constant electric and magnetic fields?) and can you then make these models more complex? I think that might hepl me understand what level you are aiming for in the end.

* Score: 16/20


## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: It sounds like your project will be modeling the motion of particles using a Python module. I think the idea behind your project is reasonable, but I'm concerned about the scale of what you might do. So, in the next writeup as you begin to plan the project, I want to see more detail about what you will actually do. That module is a pretty complete, research-level tool and I'd be concerned about you biting off too much on this. I think you will also want to not just use the module, but also explain how the algorithm is working and what is being modeled. So in the next writeup, please begin to document that and explain what you will do in more detail. This is a project that does align with what I'm expecting of you; I just want to make sure that you are proposing something that is tractable in the amount of time you have while still hitting all the important points of the project.
