## Homework assignment 6

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, first the figures. I think you have chosen some of the essential figures to illustrate what you are doing, but I tihnk more important than presenting any one of them is thinking about how to present them as a story of what you are modeling. That is, how do you get from one to the next. For some it's easy, this is just a later evolution of them same thing and see how it's changed. For others you will need to think hard about how the figures are connected together so that they tell a complete story about how the particle motion connects to the beam. So that being said, the poster layout is fine, but green text on a green background is really hard to read and probably won't print nicely. The white really pops, so maybe that or a light grey if you don't want to use the same color as the title. The layout is fine, but the content will also need to be thought through. The thing you shouldn't do is say, oh we did this project and used FODO the end. You want to help me and your classmates understand what you are trying to model and what FODO does to make that happen. That's why you worked on explaining the code to me. So, spend some space the "models" section to talk about what FODO is doing and how it is modeling what you want. Finally, for references, enumerate them and make sure they are linked to some part of the text. That is, "We used FODO [1]" where [1] is then cited. Good work on this!

## Homework assignment 5

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, thanks for doing exactly what I asked of you. I think you have everything you need here for a poster (in fact, you might have too many figures!). You will need to think about how to conceptually lay out your poster so that folks understand the system, then what the model is doing, and then the results (i.e., the figures). I suspect this will take some thinking on your part this week as you have a lot to work with. I don't think you need code in the poster, but you can talk through pseudocode or even just explain what he code does in a step-by-step manner. In any event, I'd suggest that you try to make a mock poster up and choose the feedback that you need to make it better. Great job this week!

## Homework assignment 4

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I'm happy to see you've gotten the code working. Because you are modifying existing code, I will have a much hgiher demand on you being able to explain what the code is doing and how you know that. Additionally, you will need to be able to explain all the plots that it appears to produce. It's fine to use an exisiting package like you are, but you will need to make sure that you understand how everything works and be able to explain it. I would say you should spend the week making sure that you can do that. Great job getting things working.

## Homework assignment 3

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I'm glad to see that you feel the contributions on this work are equal and complementary. I am getting the sense that things are progressing, but I didn't see any graphic or background work in your repository besides that information that you have gotten the software installed. It will be quite prudent to make sure that you have some sample calculations and results this week, which is why the homework is minimized this week. Please take care to make sure that you do this work quickly adn thoroughly as it will be helpful to me to be able to see your progress and offer guidance and helpful to you to get the feedback.

## Homework assignment 2

Feedback: Ruth and Dave, I think I have a really good idea of how you will split up the work, which is important that you both agreed on how that will look. I think I'm still a bit unclear of the objective of the project (i.e., what you will model, what scale of problem you are intending to solve, etc.). The general statements about using the module to model particles doesn't let me know what you are limiting yourself to do or including in the model. Let me suggest that you start with some of the simplest models that you can explain easily (i.e., does the module let you model the motion of chsrges in constant electric and magnetic fields?) and can you then make these models more complex? I think that might hepl me understand what level you are aiming for in the end.

## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: It sounds like your project will be modeling the motion of particles using a Python module. I think the idea behind your project is reasonable, but I'm concerned about the scale of what you might do. So, in the next writeup as you begin to plan the project, I want to see more detail about what you will actually do. That module is a pretty complete, research-level tool and I'd be concerned about you biting off too much on this. I think you will also want to not just use the module, but also explain how the algorithm is working and what is being modeled. So in the next writeup, please begin to document that and explain what you will do in more detail. This is a project that does align with what I'm expecting of you; I just want to make sure that you are proposing something that is tractable in the amount of time you have while still hitting all the important points of the project.
